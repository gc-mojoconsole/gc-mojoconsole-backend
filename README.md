EN|[中文](./README-zh.md)

MojoConsolePlus(MCP) is a [Grasscutter](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter) plugin (Apart from 4Benj's GCGM plugin) and it's goal is to implement fully in-game webwiew based .

| Grasscutter version | MojoConsole version |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1.2.1-dev           | [1.2.0-dev](https://github.com/gc-mojoconsole/gc-mojoconsole-backend/releases/tag/dev-1.2.0)           |
| 1.2.2-dev           | [1.3.0-dev](https://github.com/gc-mojoconsole/gc-mojoconsole-backend/releases/tag/dev-1.3.0)           |
| 1.2.3-dev           | [1.4.0-dev](https://github.com/gc-mojoconsole/gc-mojoconsole-backend/releases/tag/dev-1.4.0)           |

## Currently Features: 
- [x] Send console link in game
- [x] Do what players can do in the in-game chat based console
    - [x] Inherit the original permission system
    - [x] Capture command response to plugin instead of send chat to player
- [x] More configurable
- [x] Use external CDN

## Important Notes:
This plugin is made to run on the current [Development](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/tree/development) branch of Grasscutter. \
This plugin is in very early development and only have the backend now. Frontend is extermely hardcore.
**If you require support please ask on the [Grasscutter Discord](https://discord.gg/T5vZU6UyeG). However, support is not guarenteed.**

**MojoConsolePlus is decoupled with any frontend yet, feel free to open a PR to introduce your implented frontend.**

Development frontend for MojoConsolePlus don't have to restart the Grasscutter server. Just refresh page! There will be a URL printed to the console as log to help you access the console in your browser for development.

## Setup 
### Download Plugin Jar

See realeases.

### Compile yourself
1. Pull the latest code from github using ``git clone https://github.com/mingjun97/gc-mojoconsole-plus`` in your terminal of choice.
2. Locate your grasscutter server and copy the ``grasscutter`` server jar into the newly created ``gc-mojoconsole-backend/gc-plugin/lib`` folder
3. Navigate back into the project root folder called ``gc-mojoconsole-plus`` folder and run ``gradlew build`` (cmd) **or** ``./gradlew build`` (Powershell, Linux & Mac).
4. Assuming the build succeeded, in your file explorer navigate to the ``gc-plugin`` folder, you should have a ``mojoconsole.jar`` file, copy it.
5. Navigate to your ``Grasscutter`` server, find the ``plugins`` folder and paste the ``mojoconsole.jar`` into it. 
6. Start your server.

### Usage

You have two options for hosting frontend.

#### Use CDN hosted frontend(Recommended)

7. Pull the file `mojoconfig.json` into your `plugins` folder, set the `useCDN` to `true`. Alternatively, you can launch the grasscutter first, then the `mojoconfig.json` will be auto generated.
8. Modify the `config.json` of Grasscutter, make sure the `cors` is enabled. It's required in CDN mode.  See `config.json`->`server`->`policies`->`cors`.

CDN serving frontend is hosted by us via the github pages. The credentials will be passed via the hash paramets, which means the credentials(i.e. User session key, access address for your grasscutter server) will not be passed through the network. We will update our CDN frontend regularly, so that you don't have to handle the frontend update by yourself and always enjoy the latest version. Enabling `CORS` will not put your grasscutter in dangerous. It's just for protecting users accessed on browser from potential information leakage in some rare circumstances, and grasscutter actually don't have this concern.

#### Self hosted frontend
7. Put the all the frontend files into the folder `GRASSCUTTER_ROOT/plugins/mojoconsole/`. Note that your must have `console.html` for now. You are free to put any other dynamiclly loaded file(e.g. `.js`, `.css`) in that folder. Check the last section for current avialable frontend.

#### Commands for mojo

8. Send command `/mojoconsole` or `/mojo` to server in game, and you will receive mail in your mailbox. Then follow the instructions there. Note that you may use `o` option to use the pop out browser instead of in-game webwiew, e.g. `/mojo o`. By default, the console is in-game webview.

Your final plugins folder's directory structure should look similar to this
```
GRASSCUTTER_ROOT
|   grasscutter.jar
|   resources
|   data
|   ...
└───plugins
    │   mojoconsole.jar
    │   ...
    └───mojoconsole
        │   console.html
        |   ...
        └───any other file that you want to include in your frontend
            │   ...
```

        "k": "SESSION_KEY", // **DEPRECATED** sesssion key is embedded in the mail, can be retreved via the GET params.
        "k2": "AUTH_KEY",   // auth key, this is the second version auth key, choose either `k` or `k2`
        "request": "invoke", // set request to ping will ignore the payload, which just check the aliveness of current sessionKey 
        "payload": "command just like what you do in your in game chat console" // example: "heal" for heal all avatars
    }
```

Response: `Content-Type: application/json`
```json
    {
        "message": "success", // message saying the execution status,
        "code": 200, // could be 200 - success, 403 - SessionKey invalid, 500 - Command execution error (should from command), 400 - request not supported
        "payload": "response for the command", // example: got "All characters have been healed." when invoking with "heal"
    }
```

URL: `/mojoplus/auth` Request a auth key for player

Request: `Content-Type: application/json`
```json
    {
        "uid": "UID", // player uid to be requested

    }
```

Response: `Content-Type: application/json`
```json
    {
        "message": "success", // message saying the execution status,
        "code": 200, // could be 200 - success, check content in `key` field,
                     // 404 - Player not found or offline
                     // 201 - Not ready yet, player has not confirmed yet
                     // 400 - request not supported
        "key": "OTP or AUTH_KEY", // with `otp` field: AUTH_KEY for that player
                                  // without `otp` field: `OTP` for further request
    }
```

## Resources

You can use the following function to send the request, just plug it after you finished the command generation job. `payload` is the command you wish to send.

```javascript
function sendCommand(payload){
    var client = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var key = new window.URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("k");
    var url = '/mojoplus/api';
    client.open("POST", url, true);
    client.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    client.onreadystatechange = function () {
        if (client.readyState === 4 && client.status === 200) {
            var result = document.getElementById("c2");
            // Print received data from server
            result.innerHTML = JSON.parse(this.responseText).payload.replace(/\n/g, "<p/>");
        }
    };

    // Converting JSON data to string
    var data = JSON.stringify({ "k": key, "request": "invoke", "payload": payload });
    // Sending data with the request
    client.send(data);
}
```
